# SocialMediaConcept

1. <h3> Project description: </h3> 
Vibe is an concept of a social media platform. A lot of the idea is yet to be developed. This website is only a exploratory starting point. This website was for SE_19. 

2. Project Functionality: 
Current the project is a responsive website, where one can login if they are present in the database. Several features which include inteactive UI and subscribing to a mailing list. There is an admin section present along with a user's section, which can be accessed with respective login. 

3. How to install and run the project
 - install all the files present in the repository 
 - open them with Visual Studio Code 
 - With the Live Server extension you can open the index.html page and website should be working. 

4. Things to note
 - the backend of this project was local developed. I have used node js and postgres sql to develop the project. Meaning even though the website is deployed a lot of it's functionality will not work. I working on learning azure/aws to learn how I can host my postres databases in a more practical manner. 
 - I am aware of the securities risks. All the sensitive data I have provided (database password) is all 'dummy' data. I also realised it would be more secure and efficient for me to use an ORM for my website. However I have never worked with ORM before and due to time contraints didn't have enough time to explore. Also aware of how prone to sql injection my website is. I will continue to work on this project and gradually fix each issue as I learn more. 

5. Extra Information.
I provided you with screenshots of my database structure to give you a better idea how it is desgined and implemented.
